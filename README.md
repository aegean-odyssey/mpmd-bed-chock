###### A Bed Chock for the Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer

A set of small chocks prevents the print bed from tilting while printing.

##### 3D PRINTING

Three (3) chocks are required. Suggested parameters for 3D printing:
```
layer height:        0.050mm
first layer height:  0.200mm
perimeters:          3
bottom solid layers: 10
top solid layers:    15
fill density:        25%
```
   
##### HOW TO USE

At the start of each print: after the printer performs its calibration
"bed taps", _gently_ slide the three (3) chocks in place under the
bed at each of the switches. This should prevent the bed from tilting.
