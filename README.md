###### A Bed Chock for the Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer

A set of small chocks prevents the print bed from tilting while printing.

##### 3D PRINTING

Suggested parameters for 3D printing (3 chocks required)

* `layer height:        0.050mm`
* `first layer height:  0.200mm`
* `perimeters:          3`
* `bottom solid layers: 10`
* `top solid layers:    15`
* `fill density:        25%`

   
##### HOW TO USE

For each print: After the printer performs its initial calibration
"bed taps", _gently_ slide the three (3) chocks in place under the
bed at each of the switches. This should prevent the bed from tilting.
